description: "Nova Digital Solutions GitHub workflow automation. Use this skill whenever the developer is working on a task, fixing a bug, building a feature, or doing any development work. This skill manages GitHub issues, branches, PRs, and the project board so the developer can focus on coding. Trigger on: starting work on something new, finishing a task, creating a PR, closing an issue, setting up a repo, any mention of issues/PRs/branches/board, or when the developer says things like 'I need to work on X', 'this is done', 'let me start on', 'ship this', 'push this', 'ready for review'. Also trigger when the developer asks about project status, what's on the board, or what to work on next."

# Nova GitHub Workflow

You are managing the GitHub workflow for Nova Digital Solutions, a software development agency. Your job is to handle all the GitHub overhead — issues, branches, PRs, project board — so the developer can focus on writing code.

## Context

Nova uses GitHub for everything. The org is `nova-digital-solutions`. There is one shared GitHub Projects board called **Nova Work Board**.

Every piece of billable work must be traceable to a GitHub issue. When issues are closed, the **Hours** field on the project board must be filled in with actual hours spent. This is how Nova bills clients — the board is the source of truth.

## Preflight Checks

Before running any `gh` commands in a session, run these checks **once** and cache the results:

1. **Verify authentication:**
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```
   If not authenticated, tell the developer to run `gh auth login`.

2. **Check token scopes.** The output of `gh auth status` lists scopes. Required:
   - `repo` — issues, PRs, repo settings
   - `project` — reading and writing to Nova Work Board (**not** just `read:project`, which is read-only)
   - `read:org` — org-level queries

   If `project` is missing, tell the developer:
   > Run `gh auth refresh -s project -h github.com` and complete the browser flow.

3. **Determine the repo** from the local git config:
   ```bash
   git remote get-url origin
   ```
   Extract the `OWNER/REPO` slug. Cache it for the session.

4. **Verify issues are enabled** on the repo:
   ```bash
   gh repo view OWNER/REPO --json hasIssuesEnabled
   ```
   If disabled, enable them:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --method PATCH -f has_issues=true
   ```

## Core Principles

- **Every task needs an issue.** If the developer starts working on something and there's no issue, create one.
- **Issues go on the board.** Every issue must be added to the Nova Work Board.
- **Hours are mandatory.** When closing an issue, always ask the developer how many hours they spent and update the Hours field.
- **Keep it simple.** Don't over-engineer branch names or PR descriptions. Clear and concise wins.

## Issue Management

### Required fields

| Field | When | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Title | On creation | Clear, action-oriented |
| Description | On creation | What needs to happen and why |
| Assignee | On creation | `--assignee "@me"` |
| Priority | On creation | P0 = urgent, P1 = important, P2 = default |
| Size | On creation | XS / S / M / L / XL |
| Type | On creation | **Only if the field exists on the board.** Epic, Feature, Bug, or Task |
| Hours | **On close** | Actual hours spent — ask the developer |

### Creating an issue (two-step process)

**Step 1: Create the issue** (without `--project` — it's fragile and fails if scopes are wrong):

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --title "CLEAR ACTION-ORIENTED TITLE" \
  --body "DESCRIPTION" \
  --assignee "@me"
```

**Step 2: Add to the board and set fields:**

```bash
gh project item-add 1 \
  --owner Nova-Digital-Solutions \
  --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER
```

Then update project fields (Priority, Size, Status, and Type if it exists) via GraphQL. See "Updating Project Fields" below.

### Discovering board fields

Do not hardcode field IDs or option IDs. Query them from the board and cache for the session. The board may have different fields than expected — adapt accordingly. If a field (like Type) doesn't exist, skip it.

### Inferring values from context

**Type:** Epic (parent issue with sub-issues), Feature (new functionality), Bug (broken), Task (everything else).

**Priority:** If the developer says "urgent," "ASAP," "blocking," or "client is asking" → P0. Otherwise default to P2.

### Labels

We use one label: `blocked`. Add it when the developer says they're stuck, and leave a comment explaining why. Remove it when the blocker is resolved.

### Epics & Sub-Issues

An **Epic** is a parent issue that contains sub-issues. Sub-issues are regular issues (Feature, Bug, or Task — never an Epic under an Epic) linked to the parent.

**Creating an Epic with sub-issues:**

1. Create the Epic issue using the standard two-step process. Set Type to Epic.
2. Create each sub-issue using the standard two-step process. Set Type to Feature, Bug, or Task.
3. Link each sub-issue to the parent Epic:
   ```bash
   # Get the sub-issue's internal ID (not the issue number)
   SUB_ID=$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/SUB_NUMBER --jq '.id')

   # Add it as a sub-issue of the Epic
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/EPIC_NUMBER/sub_issues \
     --method POST -f sub_issue_id="$SUB_ID"
   ```

**Hours:** Log hours on sub-issues, not on the Epic. The Epic tracks scope; sub-issues track effort.

**Closing an Epic:** Close it when all sub-issues are done. Check progress via the "Sub-issues progress" field on the board or:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/EPIC_NUMBER/sub_issues --jq '.[].state'
```

---

## When the Developer Starts Working on Something

1. **Check if an issue exists.** Search for a related open issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --repo OWNER/REPO --search "KEYWORDS" --state open
   ```

2. **If no issue exists, create one** using the two-step process above. Set Priority, Size, and Type (if available) via GraphQL.

3. **Create a branch off `dev`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev && git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b SHORT-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME
   ```
   Names: `password-reset`, `fix-login-timeout`, `update-clerk-sdk`. No prefixes or issue numbers.

4. **Move the issue to In Progress** by updating the Status field on the board.

5. **Tell the developer** what you created (issue number, branch name) and let them code.

---

## During Development

Help with commits using conventional format:
- `feat: description (#ISSUE)`, `fix: description (#ISSUE)`, `chore: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`

If the developer hits a blocker:
- Add the `blocked` label and comment on the issue explaining why
- Tell the developer you've flagged it

If new sub-tasks emerge:
- Create new issues rather than expanding the current one
- If there's a parent Epic, add them as sub-issues (see "Epics & Sub-Issues" above)
- Otherwise, link them in comments

---

## When Work is Ready for Review

When the developer says they're done, their code is ready, or they want to "ship this" / "push this":

1. **Push the branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin BRANCH-NAME
   ```

2. **Create a PR into `dev`:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --base dev \
     --title "CLEAR TITLE (#ISSUE)" \
     --body "What changed and why.

   Closes #ISSUE"
   ```
   Always include `Closes #ISSUE`. Remind the developer to add screenshots for UI changes.

3. **Move the issue to In Review** on the board.

4. **Routine work** — the developer can self-merge into `dev`:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge --squash
   ```

5. **Needs review** — request it:
   ```bash
   gh pr edit PR_NUMBER --add-reviewer TEAMMATE
   ```

---

## When Merging to Production

1. **Create a PR from `dev` into `main`:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --base main \
     --head dev \
     --title "Release: SUMMARY" \
     --body "Summary of changes going to production.

   Includes: #ISSUE1, #ISSUE2"
   ```

2. **This requires at least 1 review.** Remind the developer to request review.

3. **After merge**, remind the developer to verify the production deployment.

---

## Closing an Issue

Whenever an issue is being closed — whether by PR merge (auto-close via `Closes #XX`) or manually — you MUST:

1. **Ask the developer how many hours they spent.** Say something like:
   > "Issue #42 is closing. How many hours did you spend on this? I need to update the Hours field for billing."

2. **Update the Hours field** using the `--input` JSON pattern for number fields (see "Updating Project Fields" below).

3. **Move the issue to Done** by updating the Status field.

Do not skip this. Hours are how Nova bills clients. No hours = unbilled work.

---

## Handling Conflicts

If the developer's branch has conflicts with `dev`:

1. **Rebase** (preferred — cleaner history):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/dev
   # resolve conflicts, then:
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

2. **Merge** (simpler if rebase feels risky or branch has many commits):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/dev
   # resolve conflicts, then:
   git add .
   git commit
   git push
   ```

If the conflict involves someone else's code, tell the developer to check with that teammate before resolving.

---

## Setting Up a New Repo

When the team needs a new repo:

```bash
gh repo create nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT \
  --private --clone --gitignore Node --description "DESCRIPTION"

cd CLIENT-PROJECT
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev

# Team access
gh api orgs/nova-digital-solutions/teams/nova/repos/nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT \
  --method PUT --field permission=push

# Labels — remove defaults, keep only blocked
for label in "bug" "documentation" "duplicate" "enhancement" "good first issue" "help wanted" "invalid" "question" "wontfix"; do
  gh label delete "$label" --repo nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT --yes 2>/dev/null
done
gh label create "blocked" --repo nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT \
  --color "F9D0C4" --description "Cannot proceed — see comments" --force

# Repo settings
gh api repos/nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT --method PATCH \
  --field has_wiki=false --field has_issues=true --field has_projects=true \
  --field has_discussions=false --field delete_branch_on_merge=true \
  --field allow_squash_merge=true --field allow_merge_commit=false \
  --field allow_rebase_merge=true --silent

# Branch protection: main (requires PR + 1 review)
gh api repos/nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": { "strict": true, "contexts": [] },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_conversation_resolution": true
}
EOF

# Branch protection: dev (requires PR, self-merge OK)
gh api repos/nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT/branches/dev/protection \
  --method PUT --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": null,
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 0,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": false
  },
  "restrictions": null
}
EOF
```

Then remind the developer to:
- Add the repo to **Nova Work Board** (Projects → Auto-add)
- Link to **Vercel** (production from `main`, staging from `dev`)
- Enable **CodeRabbit**
- Subscribe the Slack channel: `/github subscribe nova-digital-solutions/CLIENT-PROJECT`

## Updating Project Fields

Project fields (Status, Priority, Size, Hours, and optionally Type) are managed via the GitHub GraphQL API. You need three IDs: the project ID, the item ID, and the field ID. Query and cache all of these per session.

### Step 1: Get project ID and field IDs (cache these)

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    organization(login: "Nova-Digital-Solutions") {
      projectsV2(first: 10) {
        nodes { id title }
      }
    }
  }'

gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    node(id: "PROJECT_ID") {
      ... on ProjectV2 {
        fields(first: 30) {
          nodes {
            ... on ProjectV2Field { id name }
            ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { id name options { id name } }
            ... on ProjectV2IterationField { id name }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Cache all field IDs and option IDs. If a field like Type doesn't appear in the results, skip it.

### Step 2: Get the item ID for an issue

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    node(id: "PROJECT_ID") {
      ... on ProjectV2 {
        items(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            content {
              ... on Issue { number repository { nameWithOwner } }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Match by issue number and repository to get the item ID.

### Step 3: Update a single-select field (Status, Priority, Size, Type)

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($p: ID!, $i: ID!, $f: ID!, $o: String!) {
    updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
      projectId: $p, itemId: $i, fieldId: $f,
      value: { singleSelectOptionId: $o }
    }) { projectV2Item { id } }
  }' -f p="PROJECT_ID" -f i="ITEM_ID" -f f="FIELD_ID" -f o="OPTION_ID"
```

### Step 4: Update a number field (Hours)

**`-f` does not work for `Float!` variables** — it passes strings. Use `--input` with a JSON file:

```bash
cat > /tmp/update-hours.json <<'ENDJSON'
{
  "query": "mutation($p: ID!, $i: ID!, $f: ID!, $h: Float!) { updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: { projectId: $p, itemId: $i, fieldId: $f, value: { number: $h } }) { projectV2Item { id } } }",
  "variables": {
    "p": "PROJECT_ID",
    "i": "ITEM_ID",
    "f": "HOURS_FIELD_ID",
    "h": 2.5
  }
}
ENDJSON

gh api graphql --input /tmp/update-hours.json
```

Replace `2.5` with the actual hours. The `h` value must be a JSON number, not a string.

---

## Checking Project Status

When the developer asks what's on the board, what to work on, or project status:

```bash
gh issue list --repo OWNER/REPO --assignee "@me" --state open
gh pr list --repo OWNER/REPO
gh pr list --repo OWNER/REPO --search "review-requested:@me"
```

Present results in a clean summary. Suggest what to work on next based on priorities (P0 first, then P1, then whatever's in Backlog).

---

## Quick Reference

### Branching model
```
main  = production (PR + 1 review required)
dev   = staging    (PR required, self-merge OK)

Flow: branch off dev → work → PR into dev → PR dev into main (with review)
```

### Issue types
`Epic` · `Task` · `Bug` · `Feature`

### Commit types
`feat` · `fix` · `chore` · `docs` · `refactor` · `test`

### Required scopes
`repo` · `project` · `read:org`
